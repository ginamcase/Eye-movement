# Eye-movement
This repository is for an MITxPRO class assignment where we were asked to create some eyes and the pupils follow the mouse around the page.

To Operate: Simply load page and move mouse around to make pupils follow along.

Future Improvements: Make a second eyeball, maybe add other facial features, add a mouth where you click it and it opens/closes/sticks tongue out.
